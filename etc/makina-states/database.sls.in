# This file is consumed by mc_pillar
# This is an arbitrary, consise but still human readable document oriented database
# to describe your infrastructure from end to end

# In the longterm, this file will be autogenerated by the corpus system.

# This file does not do much at first but has a lot of examples to let you understand
# how to use mc_pillar to manage your infrastructure

# This configuration structure would answer to the IAAS
# layer of a cloud service.
